# 🎮 King of Pirates (KOP) – Cloud Gaming App

Welcome to **King of Pirates (KOP)** – a Python-based cloud gaming simulation that uses **Queue Data Structures** to manage player access based on priority.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (ADSA)** course at Alliance University.

The app simulates a real-time cloud gaming environment where **VIP** and **Regular** users wait in queues to access limited game servers.

## 🧠 Core Concept

The main concept applied in this project is the **Queue Data Structure**:

- `Queue`: For regular users
- `PriorityQueue`: For VIP users
- `List / Dictionary`: To manage currently playing users

## 📌 Features

- Load games from a CSV dataset (`Gamepass_Games_v1.csv`)
- Add users dynamically (VIP and Regular)
- Prioritize VIP users using a priority queue
- Simulate a limited number of servers
- Assign random games to users
- Auto-release players after a set play duration
- Display real-time queue and server status

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for CSV handling
- **Queue / PriorityQueue** from Python's built-in `queue` module
- **Time & Random** modules for simulation

## 📂 Dataset

Dataset Source: [Xbox Game Pass Games Library on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/xbox-game-pass-games-library/data)  
File used: `Gamepass_Games_v1.csv`

## 📄 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/kop-cloud-gaming-app.git
    cd kop-cloud-gaming-app
    ```

2. Make sure you have Python installed with the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. Add the dataset `Gamepass_Games_v1.csv` to your project directory.

4. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    python kop_simulation.py
    ```

## 📷 Sample Output

```text
[+] VIP Player 'Ajay' joined the queue.
[+] Regular Player 'Nandhu' joined the queue.
[🎮] 'Ajay' started playing 'Halo Infinite' on Xbox
[⏹️] 'Ajay' has finished playing.
```

## 🏁 Learning Outcomes

| Concept           | Application                        | Importance                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Queue             | Player management                   | Simulates real-world waiting  |
| PriorityQueue     | VIP handling                        | Adds fairness & priority logic |
| Random & Timer    | Game assignment & session tracking  | Dynamic and real-time feel     |
| Pandas            | Data handling from CSV              | Useful for real-world datasets |
